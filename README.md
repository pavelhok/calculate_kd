Matlab script to calculate degree rank order disruption index

The script is provided as is. The script was developed for the purpose of calculating degree rank order disruption index (kD) for a research project https://osf.io/e37td/. Actual file names in the script were replaced by dummies. It is very likely that modifications are needed before it can be used for a different project (i.e., with different data structure).
